Hello and welcome to Read-Write,

This blog intends to discuss technology-related topics–everything from technology to technology. We hope to capture a more technically-oriented audience.

We will be uploading around one post per week. This will be on a Friday, unless late.

I am going by the name base_2101, which is a user name I picked out. Throughout this blog I intend to stay anonymous. I am currently in school and live in the United States which narrows it down to what ~70 million. If you couldn’t guess I enjoy technology.

I am hoping this blog won’t be as “lo” as other digitally transmitted messages!
