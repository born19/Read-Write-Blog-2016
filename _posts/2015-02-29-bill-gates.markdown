Bill Gates, a leading software developer and businessman, is currently the most successful person in the world. Currently, he is worth $79.2 Billion and developed a company that is an extremely powerful manufacturer of software. 

There are a few qualities that stand out when thinking about Bill Gates:

- Extremely competitive
- Hard work ethic
- Leader

Bill Gates was born on October 28, 1955. He was born into a fairly normal family. His mom, Mary Gates, was an accomplished businesswoman; she graduated with a MBA and served on University of Washington Board of Regents. His father, William H. Gates, Sr., served in World War Two and  earned a B.A. He served as a lawyer and now is retired.  He has two sisters and is a middle child.   

In his childhood, Bill Gates seemed to be remarkably competitive. Often he competed in games with his siblings. He was recognized for reading an entire encyclopedia. He enjoyed board games and his favorite game was Risk.

He discovered his love for computers at a local science and technology fair. He was also very talented in the subjects math and science. He was said to “lack direction” at this time of his life. He was send to a private school called Lakeside, where he developed many of his skills. Lakeside allowed their students to access a nearby computer, which at this time was extremely rare. Bill Gates sometimes snuck out of the house at night and work on his school's computer. 

Bill Gates and Paul Allen, one of his friends, worked together as teenagers on the school computer writing and developing code. They notably tried to hack into the school database to change the seating arrangements so girls would be assigned to sit next to him in his classes. Bill Gates said the following, “Paul did the computer scheduling with me. Unfortunately for him, he was two years ahead of me and he was off to college by then. So I was the one who benefited by being able to have the nice girls at least sit near me. It wasn't that I could talk to them or anything — but they were there. I think I was particularly inept at talking to girls, or thinking, 'OK — do you ask them out, do you not?' When I went off to Harvard I was a little bit more sociable. But I was below average on [the skill] talking to girls.”

Paul Allen graduated from Lakeside. During this time, Bill Gates worked as a Senate page in Washington, D.C. Paul Allen ended up coming back to work with Bill Gates after the release of the Altair 8800 computer kit. They got a job writing software on the Altair 8800. They completed this code, Bill dropped out of college, and started Microsoft. He developed some of the first code that you had to pay to access in order to copy.

Bill Gates and Microsoft bought a operating system and developed it for IBM’s strand of computers.  They called it MS-DOS. He marked this operated this operating system and it was successful. IBM wanted to buy the source code; Microsoft declined. They now had to pay a licensing fee to Microsoft. When other types computers were introduced to the market he marked the MS-DOS to those systems as well. 

Bill Gates was very competitive and his company grew exponentially. He managed the company's money well. He developed software for Apple, before copying some of their GUI mechanics. Paul Allen was diagnosed with a form of cancer and he dropped out of Microsoft for a short time.

Bill Gates was known to both understand computer mechanics and business. He would often work himself very hard, even sleeping under desks on some occasions. Jill Bennett his girlfriend at the time said that he would go for three days straight without sleep. Many people called him ruthless.

IBM later developed their own operating system call MS2. This shut Microsoft out of their biggest customer, but they continued upgrading windows. After releasing Windows 3.0 they outlasted the storm and IBM couldn’t compete. 

Bill started dating his future wife Melinda, an employe at Microsoft. They ended up getting married. Shortly after, his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer and died. This took a toll on Bill Gates. He continued his mother’s charity work by creating the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, the biggest charity organization in the world. He and Melinda had children and now moved into a large home in Medina, Washington. Now spends more time with his family.
