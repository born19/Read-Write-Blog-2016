In the coming semester, I am going to be building a railgun and a solar car. The rail gun build is for a class project, of course. But, as I learn about one thing or another, I am going to show you what I learned.

Here is my list of things to learn or touch up on:

1. Voltage, Amperage and Resistance | Short Circuits | Load | Ohm’s law
2. Reading a schematic & multimeter
3. Soldering & Serial Communication

Circuits reside in all electronics. At its most basic level, an circuit is basically a ring that current flows through. On its way from the positive end to the negative end, it interacts with elements wired into the loop.

When dealing with a circuit, an individual will need to know the following material:

- Voltage is the difference in electric potential. Think of it as the force pulling water down through a funnel and out a straw. The angle and height of the funnel has an effect on the flow of the water.

- Amperage is the rate at which you are allowing the current to flow. This is measured in Amps. This is why a one Amp charger charges your phone slower than a two amp charger.

- Resistance is the resistance to current.

Ohm’s law deals with all of these measures. Ohm’s law states the following: V = I*R. In this equation V is equal to voltage, R is equal to Resistance and I is equal to current. This is very handy and allows you to find one of the following measures given the other two.

When working with a circuit, you need to watch for the load. The load is the amount of pressure on the power supply. If you have a large load on a circuit there will be issues getting power to components. If there are too few you your circuit will short out.

Short circuiting is when you have infinite or a lot of current flowing through a circuit. If you put a load (Electrical Component) into the circuit, it will limit the current to what that component takes. But if you connect both ends of a wire to each other the following can occur:

- You can drain your battery
- You can damage the power supply
- Burn the wire up
- Etc.

Some electrical parts may also need a set amount of current and if you go over the set amount it can break. A resistor increases the resistance in a circuit limiting the current that passes through the component.
